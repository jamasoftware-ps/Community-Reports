# Login Report

## Description 
The Login Report generates a graph representing the logins to your instance based on the supplied date range. 

Please note that this data itself is suspect due to the fact that logoff time is not accurate. The logoff timestamp can be either a user directly selecting the logoff button, the session timing out, or a user closing their browser.
