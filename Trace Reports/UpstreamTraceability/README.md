# Upstream Traceability Report

## Report Summary
There are two upstream traceability reports offered of which differ in the number of traversal levels populated on the report. The UpstreamTrace.vm file will extract up to 8 levels upstream while the UpstreamTrace Two Levels_8_42.vm will strictly retrieve only two levels. Keep in mind that each relationship level traversal will increase report generation processing time exponentially.
